## ðŸ–¥Project Overview

SPIRIT breaks away from locked-down devices by:

1. **Empowering the user** â€“ you decide what runs and whatâ€™s connected.
2. **Ensuring privacy** â€“ hardware switches physically cut off mic, camera, GPS, and cellular radios.
3. **Encouraging community collaboration** â€“ hardware, firmware, and documentation are all open.

Current development is documented here and on our  
ðŸŽ¥ [V Electronics YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@V_Electronics).
